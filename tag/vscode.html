</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>An <a href="https://github.com/RileyMathews/spec-buddy">extension for VSCode</a> that allows the user to quickly open a companion spec/test file for the source file currently open. At this time, it uses a very crude search method to attempt to find the test file and only works for specific project structures. But (someday ðŸ™ƒ) I hope to re-write the core search functionality to be more generic and work for more use cases.</p>
<p>This project was very early in my software development career and taught me a lot about working within a well-defined API. The VSCode API is huge and had a lot of documentation and searching through all of that to find the functions and objects I was working with was sometimes painful but helped me develop the skill of reading documentation.</p>                </article>
