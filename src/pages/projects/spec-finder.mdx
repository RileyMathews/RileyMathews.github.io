An [extension for VSCode](https://github.com/RileyMathews/spec-finder) that allows the user to quickly open a companion spec/test file for the source file currently open.

This project is a successor to an initial project "spec buddy" that I wrote very early in my software development career and taught me a lot about working within a well-defined API. The VSCode API is huge and had a lot of documentation and searching through all of that to find the functions and objects I was working with was sometimes painful but helped me develop the skill of reading documentation.
