[Gamestone](https://github.com/RileyMathews/gamestone) was my "midstone" project at Nashville Software School. We had just finished learning Javascript and React and how to consume APIs from the front end, and the "midstone" project was to show off that ability.

The short version of the concept was that this project would be "Goodreads for video games." I used the API available from [Giantbomb](https://giantbomb.com) to let users search through video games they enjoyed, and then provided an interface that allowed them to get suggestions on similar games.

As the original project was focused on the front end with React, we originally used a simple "dummy" backend API for anything we needed to store locally. After learning Django, however, I went back and re-implemented the backend needed to support the app with the Django REST framework.

I learned a lot with this project about working with and manipulating data as the Giantbomb API contains a lot of data around tons of video games. Figuring out how to traverse their data structure to get to the data I wanted around suggesting new video games was a lot of fun!

You can view the live project [here](https://gamestone.fly.dev)!

In the app the user can search for games to add to their library, search through their library, and then have the app suggest games based on their library.
