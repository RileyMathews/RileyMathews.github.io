summary: An extension for VSCode that will quickly find and open the test file corresponding to your open source file.

An [extension for VSCode](https://github.com/RileyMathews/spec-buddy) that allows the user to quickly open a companion spec/test file for the source file currently open. At this time, it uses a very crude search method to attempt to find the test file and only works for specific project structures. But (someday ðŸ™ƒ) I hope to re-write the core search functionality to be more generic and work for more use cases.

This project was very early in my software development career and taught me a lot about working within a well-defined API. The VSCode API is huge and had a lot of documentation and searching through all of that to find the functions and objects I was working with was sometimes painful but helped me develop the skill of reading documentation.
